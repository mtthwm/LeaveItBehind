# LeaveItBehind

## Contributing

Unity isn't *technically* meant for Unity projects so we'll need to communicate effectively to avoid merge conflicts. Here are some guidelines to keep in mind.

- Make sure to work on your own branch until your new features are complete
- Communicate with others to make sure you are not working on the same scene/prefab/asset at the same time.
- Submit a PR and notify me via Discord when you're features are ready
